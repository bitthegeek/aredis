                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisClient.html?is-external=true">AsyncRedisClient</a> is a common client interface. It has two implementations <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisConnection.html?is-external=true">AsyncRedisConnection</a>
                  and <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/ShardedAsyncRedisClient.html?is-external=true">ShardedAsyncRedisClient</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you might have noticed in the Getting Started example, the API of AsyncRedisClient is designed as a generic interface
                  to submit any Redis command and not as a set of Type Safe methods, one for each command or class of commands. This is partly to
                  accommodate an Async API. So it helps to refer to the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/">Redis Command Page</a> when coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AsyncRedisConnection is the central class providing the connection to the Redis Server via an Asynchronous socket API. The
                  Asynchronous connection is abstracted by the interface <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncSocketTransport.html?is-external=true">AsyncSocketTransport</a>.
                  Currently <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncJavaSocketTransport.html?is-external=true">AsyncJavaSocketTransport</a> using the Java 7 NIO based <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.html">Asynchronous channel</a> is the only
                  implementation of the interface which is why you need Java 7.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ShardedAsyncRedisClient is an implementation of AsyncRedisClient providing Sharding of Keys across 2 or more
                  AsyncRedisConnection's. The Hash of the Key is computed and based on the Hash the command is passed on to one of the connections
                  based on a Consistent Hashing algorithm. Commands with multiple keys are not allowed unless all of the keys map to the same
                  connection. So you will get an Exception if you submit a command like MSETNX. MSET and MGET are commands with multiple keys which
                  are exceptions to this rule. For these commands the keys are distributed based on their hashes and  the results re-assembled as
                  part of the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html?is-external=true">RedisCommandInfo</a> is the DTO (Data Transfer Object) for a RedisCommand. It is a holder for the RedisCommand and its
                  parameters, the DataHandler to be used for serializing and de-serializing data and the Result. The
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html#getResult()">getResult</a> method returns a String
                  in case of a String result or Redis error. It returns the de-serialized result in case of a bulk response and an array of
                  de-serialized Objects in case of a multi-bulk response. The response is an array of RedisCommandInfo for each command in the
                  transaction in case of an EXEC command.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are different variations of the submitCommand method in AsyncRedisClient based on the following parameters:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommandInfo parameter:</b> You pass a RedisCommandInfo Object containing the command with the DataHandler along
                      with other arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommand with arguments:</b> This is a convenience wrapper on the previous set of commands where the RedisCommandInfo
                      constructor arguments are flattened along with the rest of the parameters. These method implementations construct a
                      RedisCommandInfo object and call one of the previous methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommand[] array:</b> These commands are executed together in the pipeline. So it can be used for a MULTI-EXEC set of
                      commands not requiring a WATCH on one or more keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Without a completionHandler:</b> These commands return a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">Future</a> Object on which a get method can be called to get the RedisCommandInfo
                      or RedisCommandInfo[] array containing the results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a completionHandler:</b> These are async commands that call the completionHandler with the RedisCommandInfo or RedisCommandInfo[] array
                      containing the results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a null completionHandler:</b> You can pass a null completionHandler when you want to submit the command and are not interested in the
                      results. This Send and Forget call is slightly better than using a command that returns a Future and ignoring it because the
                      Future object does not need to be created an notified. The sendCommand methods are convenience wrappers providing the same
                      functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a DataHandler:</b> The values in a Redis Command are converted to bytes when sending them and converted back to Object
                      when processing Return values using a DataHandler. You can pass a Data Handler in case you want to override the default Data
                      Handler.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  The return value if any of all submit command(s) calls is a Future Object of RedisCommandInfo or RedisCommandInfo[]; The value returned by the
                  Future is the same as what was passed with the result set in the CommandInfo(s).
                </p>
                <p>The submitCommand calls work as follows.</p>
                <p>First the command is serialized and submitted to a request Q.</p>
                <p>An async NIO based request Q listener de-queues the commands from the request Q one by one, sends them to the REDIS server and moves the command to the response Q.</p>
                <p>An async NIO based response Q listener de-queues the commands from the response Q one by one, reads and parses the corresponding response from the REDIS server and sends back the response.</p>
                <p>The de-serialization happens on the first call to getResult on the returned CommandInfo after which the de-serialized result is
                saved and returned on subsequent calls.</p>
                <p>

                  above services for a given redis server. It returns the same Object for the same connection and is the preferred way of using these

                <p>
                  JavaHandler stores and retrieves Strings or compressed Strings without any changes so that it is compatible with other clients. It
                  does this by looking for either a GZIP compression header or an aredis Marker header. If both are not found it is treated as a String.
                  If a GZIP header is found it decompresses the data and interprets it as a String if it does not begin with an aredis marker header.
                  In the unlikely case when the encoded String begins with an aredis Marker or GZIP header they are escaped with an escape marker
                  which is discarded during de-serialization. Instances of
                  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html">Number</a> like

                  are serialized and de-serialized as their String values. Other Java Objects are stored using Java Serialization and prefixed by an
                  aredis Marker sequence to indicate if it is an optimized storage or regular serialization. When optimizeObjectStorage is true then
                  The Class Descriptors for Classes is stored in a common key JAVA_CL_DESCRIPTORS as an array and what is written or read from the
                  serialized data is only an index in the array. This saves the repetition of Class Descriptors data across keys. This is accomplished
                  by overriding the

                  The AsyncObjectPool used as connection pool uses a stack to maintain free connections which translates to a MRU algorithm. So even
                  if the pool size is 10 if only 2 connections are required at a time for Redis transactions only 2 socket connections are created and
                  re-used. The others are not used unless your app borrows more than 2 connections at a given point of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Re-connects:</b> Whenever a Network error occurs the commands already sent are returned with a status of NETWORK_ERROR which also
                  means that it is not known if the commands were executed by the Redis Server or not. The commands which are not yet sent are
                  returned immediately with a status of SKIPPED. Re-connects are attempted during future submitCommand calls with an exponential back-off
                  algorithm (Re-tries at 0.01s, 0.1s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s ...) till 2 minutes after which there is a re-try every 2 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By default the AsyncJavaSocketTransport uses only 10 daemon threads to manage all socket connections via NIO. You can change this for the
                  entire JVM by initializing
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncJavaSocketTransport.html#channelGroup">AsyncJavaSocketTransport.channelGroup</a> in the
                  static block of one of your classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also a pool of 10 threads used by
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisConnection.html#bootstrapExecutor">AsyncRedisConnection.bootstrapExecutor</a>. This
                  Thread pool is also configured to shutdown all idle threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using aredis with Async callbacks or RedisSubscription it is better you configure AsyncRedisFactory with a non-null Executor so
                  that your callbacks do not use the internal threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also 1 thread used by AsyncRedisFactory for the purposes of closing idle connections, checking Connection Pool leaks and
                  re-connecting broken connections for RedisSubscription.
                  If you already have a scheduler in your system you can configure AsyncRedisFactory to use it instead of creating a new timer and
                  thread by providing an implementation of <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/util/RedisTimer.html">RedisTimer</a> and calling
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisFactory.html#setTimer(org.aredis.util.RedisTimer)">AsyncRedisFactory.setTimer</a>.

                  AREDIS allows configuration of most parameters. You can configure AsyncRedisFactory to change your default handler and connection
                  pool size. You can also configure OPTI_JAVA_HANDLER to use a common Redis Server for storing class descriptors instead of the
                  connection's server by using RedisClassDescriptorStorageFactory instead of the default
                  PerConnectionRedisClassDescriptorStorageFactory. Please refer to the <a href= ../javadocs>javadocs</a> for more info. You can check
                  the test directory for a custom data handler for mapping objects to json format using
                  <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome">jackson API</a>.
