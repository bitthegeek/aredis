                <p>
                  As you might have noticed in the Getting Started example, the API of
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisClient.html">AsyncRedisClient</a> is designed as generic methods to submit any
                  Redis command and not as a set of Type Safe methods, one for each command or class of commands. This is to accommodate a Future
                  based synchronous API and Async API. So it helps to refer to the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/">Redis Command Page</a> when
                  coding. Adding a new Redis Command introduced in a Redis Server release can be done by simply adding to the
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommand.html">RedisCommand</a> enum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The API takes a RedisCommand enum value identifying the command followed by a variable argument list for the command parameters.
                  Each command has an argInfo String given in the Enum constructor which identifies each of the command parameters, whether it is a,
                  key, qualifier or value. Using the argInfo for the command the API treats each parameter as a key, parameter (qualifier) or value.
                  Keys and qualifiers are usually Strings in the vararg list at are sent to redis after encoding them in UTF-8. The keys can be byte
                  arrays if they cannot be represented as UTF-8. The values can be Strings or any other Serializable java Objects and are converted to
                  bytes using a Data Handler. The default data handler stores Strings smaller than 1024 bytes as it is using UTF-8 encoding which
                  makes String values compatible with other language clients. The default data handler compresses Strings or serialized values larger
                  than 1 Kb using gzip.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The result of running the command is contained in a <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html">RedisCommandInfo</a>
                  Object which is returned by the API either as a Future<RedisCommandInfo> return value or as a parameter in the supplied callback in
                  Async mode. The <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html#getResult()">getResult</a> method of RedisCommandInfo
                  returns the result which is of type Object. The Object returned is a String for INT, String and Redis Error responses. For bulk
                  responses the data handler is used to convert the response to a String or the Object which was stored. For Commands like
                  <a href="http://redis.io/commands/INCR">INCR</a> where you know that the response is an int or double you can use methods
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html#getIntResult(int)">getIntResult</a> or
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html#getDoubleResult(double)">getDoubleResult</a> of RedisCommandInfo to convert
                  the String result to your data type. For multi-bulk (Array) response the return value is an array of Objects each of which contains
                  the individual result in the multi-bulk response. The result is null for a null bulk or multi-bulk response and also in case of an
                  error executing the command such as a network error in which case the getRunStatus method returns the appropriate status other than
                  SUCCESS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For more details about the API please see the section on important classes, examples and also the <a href="../javadocs/">Javadocs</a>.

                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisClient.html">AsyncRedisClient</a> is a common client interface. It has two implementations <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisConnection.html">AsyncRedisConnection</a>
                  and <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/ShardedAsyncRedisClient.html">ShardedAsyncRedisClient</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AsyncRedisConnection is the central class providing the connection to the Redis Server via an Asynchronous socket API. The
                  Asynchronous connection is abstracted by the interface <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncSocketTransport.html">AsyncSocketTransport</a>.
                  Currently <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncJavaSocketTransport.html">AsyncJavaSocketTransport</a> using the Java 7 NIO based <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.html">Asynchronous channel</a> is the only
                  implementation of the interface which is why you need Java 7.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ShardedAsyncRedisClient is an implementation of AsyncRedisClient providing Sharding of Keys across 2 or more
                  AsyncRedisConnection's. The Hash of the Key is computed and based on the Hash the command is passed on to one of the connections
                  based on a Consistent Hashing algorithm. Commands with multiple keys are not allowed unless all of the keys map to the same
                  connection. So you will get an Exception if you submit a command like MSETNX. MSET and MGET are commands with multiple keys which
                  are exceptions to this rule. For these commands the keys are distributed based on their hashes and  the results re-assembled as
                  part of the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html">RedisCommandInfo</a> is the DTO (Data Transfer Object) for a
                  RedisCommand. It is a holder for the RedisCommand and its parameters, the DataHandler to be used for serializing and de-serializing
                  data and the Result. The <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/RedisCommandInfo.html#getResult()">getResult</a> method returns a
                  String in case of a String result or Redis error. It returns the de-serialized result in case of a bulk response and an array of
                  de-serialized Objects in case of a multi-bulk response. The response is an array of RedisCommandInfo for each command in the
                  transaction in case of an EXEC command. getResult returns null in case of a null bulk or multi-bulk response and also in case of an
                  error executing the command such as a network error in which case the getRunStatus method returns the appropriate status other than
                  SUCCESS. null is also returned in case EXEC fails because of a change in a watched key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are different variations of the submitCommand method in AsyncRedisClient based on the following parameters:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommandInfo parameter:</b> You pass a RedisCommandInfo Object containing the command with the DataHandler along
                      with other arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommand with arguments:</b> This is a convenience wrapper on the previous set of commands where the RedisCommandInfo
                      constructor arguments are flattened along with the rest of the parameters. These method implementations construct a
                      RedisCommandInfo object and call one of the previous methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>RedisCommand[] array:</b> These commands are executed together in the pipeline. So it can be used for a MULTI-EXEC set of
                      commands not requiring a WATCH on one or more keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Without a completionHandler:</b> These commands return a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">Future</a> Object on which a get method can be called to get the RedisCommandInfo
                      or RedisCommandInfo[] array containing the results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a completionHandler:</b> These are async commands that call the completionHandler with the RedisCommandInfo or RedisCommandInfo[] array
                      containing the results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a null completionHandler:</b> You can pass a null completionHandler when you want to submit the command and are not interested in the
                      results. This Send and Forget call is slightly better than using a command that returns a Future and ignoring it because the
                      Future object does not need to be created and notified. The sendCommand methods are convenience wrappers providing the same
                      functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>With a DataHandler:</b> The values in a Redis Command are converted to bytes when sending them and converted back to Object
                      when processing Return values using a DataHandler. You can pass a Data Handler in case you want to override the default Data
                      Handler.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  The return value if any of all submit command(s) calls is a Future Object of RedisCommandInfo or RedisCommandInfo[]; The value returned by the
                  Future is the same as what was passed with the result set in the CommandInfo(s).
                </p>
                <p>The submitCommand calls work as follows.</p>
                <p>First the command is serialized and submitted to a request Q.</p>
                <p>An async NIO based request Q listener de-queues the commands from the request Q one by one, sends them to the REDIS server and moves the command to the response Q.</p>
                <p>An async NIO based response Q listener de-queues the commands from the response Q one by one, reads and parses the corresponding response from the REDIS server and sends back the response.</p>
                <p>The de-serialization happens on the first call to getResult on the returned CommandInfo after which the de-serialized result is
                saved and returned on subsequent calls.</p>

                <p>
                  JavaHandler stores and retrieves Strings or compressed Strings without any changes so that it is compatible with other clients. It
                  does this by looking for either a GZIP compression header or an aredis Marker header. If both are not found it is treated as a String.
                  If a GZIP header is found it decompresses the data and interprets it as a String if it does not begin with an aredis marker header.
                  In the unlikely case when the encoded String begins with an aredis Marker or GZIP header they are escaped with an escape marker
                  which is discarded during de-serialization. Instances of
                  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html">Number</a> like

                  are serialized and de-serialized as their String values. Other Java Objects are stored using Java Serialization and prefixed by an
                  aredis Marker sequence to indicate if it is an optimized storage or regular serialization. When optimizeObjectStorage is true then
                  The Class Descriptors for Classes is stored in a common key JAVA_CL_DESCRIPTORS as an array and what is written or read from the
                  serialized data is only an index in the array. This saves the repetition of Class Descriptors data across keys. This is accomplished
                  by overriding the
                  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeClassDescriptor(java.io.ObjectStreamClass)">ObjectOutputStream.writeClassDescriptor</a>

                  Aredis tries to reduce the usage of Socket connections and Threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Socket connections are created by AsyncRedisConnection or RedisSubscription only when they are first used. When the connection is
                  unused for more than 15 minutes (or the Redis Server timeout if that is lesser) the connection is detected as idle and closed. It is
                  re-opened only when it is used again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The AsyncObjectPool used as connection pool uses a stack to maintain free connections which translates to a MRU algorithm. So even
                  if the pool size is 10 if only 2 connections are required at a time for Redis transactions only 2 socket connections are created and
                  re-used. The others are not used unless your app borrows more than 2 connections at a given point of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Re-connects:</b> Whenever a Network error occurs the commands already sent are returned with a status of NETWORK_ERROR which also
                  means that it is not known if the commands were executed by the Redis Server or not. The commands which are not yet sent are
                  returned immediately with a status of SKIPPED. Re-connects are attempted during future submitCommand calls with an exponential back-off
                  algorithm (Re-tries at 0.01s, 0.1s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s ...) till 2 minutes after which there is a re-try every 2 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By default the AsyncJavaSocketTransport uses only 10 daemon threads to manage all socket connections via NIO. You can change this for the
                  entire JVM by initializing
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/net/AsyncJavaSocketTransport.html#channelGroup">AsyncJavaSocketTransport.channelGroup</a> in the
                  static block of one of your classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also a pool of 10 threads used by
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisConnection.html#bootstrapExecutor">AsyncRedisConnection.bootstrapExecutor</a>. This
                  Thread pool is also configured to shutdown all idle threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using aredis with Async callbacks or RedisSubscription it is better you configure AsyncRedisFactory with a non-null Executor so
                  that your callbacks do not use the internal threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also 1 thread used by AsyncRedisFactory for the purposes of closing idle connections, checking Connection Pool leaks and
                  re-connecting broken connections for RedisSubscription.
                  If you already have a scheduler in your system you can configure AsyncRedisFactory to use it instead of creating a new timer and
                  thread by providing an implementation of <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/util/RedisTimer.html">RedisTimer</a> and calling
                  <a href="../javadocs/org/aredis/cache/AsyncRedisFactory.html#setTimer(org.aredis.util.RedisTimer)">AsyncRedisFactory.setTimer</a>.

                  <a href="http://redis.io/commands/script-load">SCRIPT LOAD</a> command to load the script if SCRIPT EXISTS returns 0. This is done
